# 1) full interface file. Hard to explain, made manually. Took PDB file of OSAKA fragment of amyloid, residues 10-23 (inclusive). 
#and entended the sheet in both directions by duplicating a few chains and best aligning 2 strands to the original sheet (then hanging 3-4 strands are added).
# Renamed chains to remove overlap... save to ~/peptideAmyloid/parameterization/FullInterface.pdb 
# A in most negative Y direction, K in most positive Y

#) helix to dock, file all saved in helix_prep/ (see path below). From pdb 2ZTA aka GCN4, residues 7-24 (inclusive). Save to 18_2zta.pdb
# fit helical axis w/ PS program, Get from stdout: CA coordinates projected onto axis from output of PS (PS.linux is compiled w/ gfortran4.8).  
## or grab any segment from a CCCP coiled-coil bundle.

> mkdir ~/peptideAmyloid/parameterization/helix_prep

> ~/bin/PS.linux -i ~/peptideAmyloid/parameterization/helix_prep/18_2zta.pdb -f 7 -l 24

# Save axis coords to '~/peptideAmyloid/parameterization/helix_prep/CA_18_2zta.pdb'

# **** NOTE ***** Copy HETATM lines of PDB from C and N termini of axis to the end of 18_2zta.pdb, change to chain 'X'
# rename helical chain to A
# put the HETATM's from CA fitting from PS at bottom of file:  C-term, then N-term



## For visualization ONLY... (Local) and semi manual... make PDB file "zeroAlignment.pdb" with atoms as markers to new coordinate frame
#  For alignment of the OSAKA amyloid interface to 5 points in a new "centered" coordinate frame where helix center to be at (0,0,0)
# order of C-alpha atoms in file is same as odrder of REMARKS, the latter having pymol selection strings for residue/atom that should be aligned to this point. These atoms are hard coded into python script

> python ~/bin/quickAlignOsk.py ~/peptideAmyloid/parameterization/FullInterface.pdb ~/peptideAmyloid/parameterization/zeroAlignment.pdb 


## Note, did this same protocol for straight (w_0 = 100, curvature = inf) helix ''... 
## with 2D wall paper symmetry, aligning a helix to X-axis and setting z coords of each helical axis to 4 A above amyloid center...
## added previous and next symmetry mate, the did strucctural search of 12-center most residues on i to i+1 interface and i-1 to i itnerface. 
## with both GCN4 and ideal helix, got >250 sub-angstrom full backbone matches to the pdb files of both interfaces (2 helices with 12 residues each, axis 10 A away. )
## Hence these interfaces are generally designable
