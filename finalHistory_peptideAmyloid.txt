# Uses PS – a program for the analysis of helix geometry... J. Mol. Graph. Model. (2011), doi:10.1016/j.jmgm.2011.11.004 (must compile this fortran source code)
# All other code and modules references found in Marco's ~/bin/ folder (See github repository for maintained directory)

##### Database ( constructed ) #####
##### Search database construction, (PDB subset turned into .pds files, formatted as searchable 'targets' by program MASTER )

## Remade single chain non-redundent database. from 30% culling of chains by BLASTClust on PDB. X-ray only < 2.8 A from 152901_bc_30-scPDB.txt
## Got entries_xray_res.txt pdb_seqres-byCh.txt from PDB website... look in files for what info is in there... x-ray, length, resolution
## "Summaries of PDB data" page, entries.idx & pdb_seqres.txt      http://www.rcsb.org/pdb/static.do?p=general_information/about_pdb/summaries.html

. cd ~/termanal/support.default/

# Then download this list of PDB chains (if not too large, like ribosome cuz different file format), extract chain to new file, run createPDS to get parsed output PDB and MASTER format searchable .pds 'target' file

# Then with some bash terminal, print the full path to each .pds into 'list.txt' inside databse directory '152901_bc_30-scPDB/'; one path per line

# comment amove command will mention (LOCAL) if done on laptop or (CLUSTER) if done on interactive node of UCSF QB3 cluster (including job submission)
# All files were passed between cluster and local through git repository (~/bin for code and ~/peptideAmyloid for working space)
# All paths should be the same after '~/', where ~/ depends on local or cluster...
# Except linux TERMANAL and database... were tarballed and transferred to 

#### Prelim file prep ####

> mkdir ~/peptideAmyloid
> mkdir ~/peptideAmyloid/parameterization

# 1) full interface file. Hard to explain, made manually. Took PDB file of OSAKA fragment of amyloid, residues 10-23 (inclusive). 
#and entended the sheet in both directions by duplicating a few chains and best aligning 2 strands to the original sheet (then hanging 3-4 strands are added).
# Renamed chains to remove overlap... save to ~/peptideAmyloid/parameterization/FullInterface.pdb 
# A in most negative Y direction, K in most positive Y

#) helix to dock, file all saved in helix_prep/ (see path below). From pdb 2ZTA aka GCN4, residues 7-24 (inclusive). Save to 18_2zta.pdb
# fit helical axis w/ PS program, Get from stdout: CA coordinates projected onto axis from output of PS (PS.linux is compiled w/ gfortran4.8).  

> mkdir ~/peptideAmyloid/parameterization/helix_prep

> ~/bin/PS.linux -i ~/peptideAmyloid/parameterization/helix_prep/18_2zta.pdb -f 7 -l 24

# Save axis coords to '~/peptideAmyloid/parameterization/helix_prep/CA_18_2zta.pdb'
# Copy HETATM lines of PDB from C and N termini of axis to the end of 18_2zta.pdb, change to chain 'X'
# Make some other file with two HETATMS with coords: -12.885  -0.000   0.000 & 12.885  -0.000   0.000
# IN pymol, use pair fitting wizard to fit two axis points (chain X) to these X-axis markers...
# This should align the entire 18_2zta.pdb to X-axis. Save the aligned molecule 18_2ztaCEN.pdb (in helix_prep/)


## For visualization ONLY... (Local) and semi manual... make PDB file "zeroAlignment.pdb" with atoms as markers to new coordinate frame
#  For alignment of the OSAKA amyloid interface to 5 points in a new "centered" coordinate frame where helix center to be at (0,0,0)
# order of C-alpha atoms in file is same as odrder of REMARKS, the latter having pymol selection strings for residue/atom that should be aligned to this point. These atoms are hard coded into python script

> python ~/bin/quickAlignOsk.py ~/peptideAmyloid/parameterization/FullInterface.pdb ~/peptideAmyloid/parameterization/zeroAlignment.pdb 


## Note, did this same protocol for straight (w_0 = 100, curvature = inf) helix ''... 
## with 2D wall paper symmetry, aligning a helix to X-axis and setting z coords of each helical axis to 4 A above amyloid center...
## added previous and next symmetry mate, the did strucctural search of 12-center most residues on i to i+1 interface and i-1 to i itnerface. 
## with both GCN4 and ideal helix, got >250 sub-angstrom full backbone matches to the pdb files of both interfaces (2 helices with 12 residues each, axis 10 A away. )
## Hence these interfaces are generally designable
